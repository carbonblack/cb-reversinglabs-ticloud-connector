; Concurrency settings
;
; The following two parameters control how many concurrent queries will be
; performed against the ReversingLabs server. The "quick_scan_threads" setting
; specifies how many threads will be querying the reversinglabs appliance via
; file hash at once. The "deep_scan_threads" setting specifies how many
; full file scans can be actively "in flight" at a given time. The default
; is that three files can be analyzed in parallel at any given time.
;
; ***WARNING***
;
; By setting reversinglabs_deep_scan_threads to GREATER THAN zero and submit_full_binaries to 1, you will be submitting
; FULL binaries to ReversingLabs for analysis. This is different from reversinglabs_quick_scan_threads which ONLY submit the
; HASH to ReversingLabs.
; submit_full_binaries: 1 = True, 0 = False
